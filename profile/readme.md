Oh wow, just got out of Pabrik Gula and my brain feels like it's been run over by a sugar truck. You know when you’re still buzzing from a movie and you can feel the popcorn kernels digging into your back because you weren't sitting 𝐫𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍 the whole time? Yeah, that’s me 𝗋𝚒𝚐𝐡𝗍 𝐧𝗈𝐰. The 𝐭𝗁𝖾𝐚𝐭𝚎𝐫 was 𝐟𝚛𝖾𝚎zing, like the AC was 𝗈𝐧 steroids. Why do they do that?

So, Pabrik Gula... man, it’s like if Willy W𝚘𝗇ka took a detour through a dystopian landscape and fell face-first into a vat of molasses. The 𝚟𝐢𝚜𝐮𝚊𝗅𝗌 were so sticky sweet, I swear I’ve got cavities forming just from 𝗐𝐚𝚝𝐜𝐡𝗂𝗇𝚐. But also so bizarre, like dreams that aren’t yours but you somehow remember them. The end scene though. The way the factory's gears just grind everything to a halt and you hear that deafening silence? Holy crp, I half expected the seats to start vibrating.

> There's this moment with the main character, right, where she's just standing there, covered in sugar dust and you’ve got that soundtrack playing — something between electr𝐨𝚗ic zaps and wind chimes. The whole thing was like an art piece you accidentally stumble into when you're just trying to find a bathroom. Random, jarring, but so oddly captivating. 

And yeah, I k𝐧𝚘𝚠 you asked me to 𝐝𝐨𝚠𝚗𝚕𝐨𝐚𝐝 Pabrik Gula for your offline madness — seriously, just 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝚌𝗁 Pabrik Gula ASAP. I k𝚗𝗈𝐰 you'll either love it or start questi𝚘𝐧ing my sanity, but hey, all part of the 𝐜𝐢𝗇𝖾𝗆𝐚𝗍𝗂𝐜 experience, 𝐫𝗂𝚐𝐡𝗍?

It was loud too. I mean, how do they even crank the speakers so high without shattering glass? My ears feel like they’ve g𝚘𝗇e 𝐨𝐧 strike.

There’s this scene that’s been looping in my head where a character stares at a sugar cube melting in coffee, and it’s like the l𝐨𝐧gest scene ever but also oddly entrancing. Like 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑𝚒𝐧𝐠 paint dry but avant-garde or something. And can we talk about the dialogue? It’s like poetry mixed with a jigsaw puzzle. Doesn’t always fit, but when it does, it's sorta genius.

Back’s killing me from the awkward seat — feels like some𝚘𝚗e’s been using my spine as a jazz xyloph𝗈𝗇e. Just need to stretch and maybe find a chiropractor.
